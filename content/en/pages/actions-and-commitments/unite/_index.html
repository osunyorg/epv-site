    <p>Connect & reunite  <br>Visits to workshops, meetings... Getting to know each other is essential to exchanging and sharing ideas on the subjects that occupy or preoccupy EPVs. Given their great diversity, ranging from one-man craft workshops to mid-sized companies, the EPV base represents a cross-section of the French economy and its difficulties, particularly when it comes to passing on know-how. But being an EPV is above all a strength. France's economic fabric can count on these craft and industrial companies to master the exceptional skills that contribute to our country's brand image. France is one of the few countries in the world to pursue an active policy of preserving and developing arts and crafts and living heritage.

Art and living heritage crafts are essential to the upkeep of our built heritage, but they also feed certain industrial sectors such as fashion and luxury goods. In addition to the well-known major groups, this sector benefits from the know-how and creativity of a network of workshops and subcontractors capable of creating exceptional pieces. While the contribution of these trades to our country's economy is undeniable, we must not overlook the fact that the companies employing them are often fragile, modest in size and sometimes struggle to recruit qualified personnel, even though human capital, even more than materials, represents a major share of the added value produced. The smallest among them - and there are many of them - are also finding it increasingly difficult to position themselves in an increasingly competitive market. It's against this backdrop that public support schemes such as the "Entreprise du Patrimoine Vivant" (EPV) scheme come into their own, and must be promoted to all sectors of the public.</p>  <p>   <br>CSR <br>In essence, our companies are structures that value people and are deeply committed to promoting and preserving our country's living heritage. We firmly believe that our companies have an essential role to play in enhancing the sustainable development of our territories. The corporate social responsibility dynamic is felt in every one of our companies. Some have expressed the need for support in structuring their information and deepening their commitment, while those who are most advanced in the field will be able to share their expertise. This is the background to the project proposed by INMA and ANEPV as part of the France 2030 "Green Alternatives 2" call for projects. This project will enable EPV companies from all regions and sectors to share their best practices on a single platform, and to assess their progress using a scale of criteria specific to their business. We will be able to qualify and quantify CSR developments for EPV companies, and help smaller structures to join this common dynamic.</p>  <p> Find out more </p>
