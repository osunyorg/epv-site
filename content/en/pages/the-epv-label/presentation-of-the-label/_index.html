        <p>Since its creation in 2005, the EPV label has highlighted unique companies that know how to reconcile innovation and tradition, know-how and creation, heritage and future, local and international. This state label is attached to the Ministry of the Economy, Finance and Industrial and Digital Sovereignty, and is awarded by regional prefects. Awarded for a period of five years, the EPV label brings together manufacturers who share a certain vision of what their company's activities should be: an entrepreneurial vision in which respect for the company's historical and heritage character and its know-how and tools are in no way in conflict, but rather nurture production quality, harmonious relations with local partners, innovative approaches and high-tech production.   </p><p>It is the only government label awarded to a company for its entire activity, guaranteeing the excellence of its know-how. </p>

        There are just 1,400 EPV-labeled companies in France, including around 100 in the Bourgogne-Franche-Comté region. Why are they so exceptional? Who are the teams who work there? They are founders, cabinetmakers, pastry chefs or button makers, and they work in an EPV entreprise du Patrimoine Vivant. This French label recognizes their exceptional know-how.<br>Reporting: Catherine Eme-Ziri / Fabienne Lemoing / Thomas Hardy / Karl Monnin / Pierre Corne
