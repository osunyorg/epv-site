  <p>                     Our company is proud to be one of the last French companies still manufacturing tapestries, cushions, fabrics and textile decoration accessories in its own workshops in the North of France, the region of the French textile industry.</p><p>Les Tissages de la Lys are the workshops of the Jules Pansu company founded in 1878 and passed on within the same family for 5 generations now. Over the years, the company has managed to combine exceptional know-how, tradition, elegance and modernity while adapting to the challenges of today and tomorrow.   </p><p>The workshops have two "Meilleurs Ouvriers de France" (Best Craftsmen in France), a guarantee of high quality associated with a strong technical potential, and since 2012, they have been labeled "Entreprise du Patrimoine Vivant" (Living Heritage Company), a mark of recognition by the State to distinguish French companies with excellent craft and industrial know-how.    </p><p> Thanks to the French and international heritage of the company, associated with the reputation of its workshops Les Tissages de la Lys, the company is now solicited by many artist foundations and designers for collaboration as well as for weaving unique pieces for public institutions and private customers.     </p><p>Thus, we collaborate with the Picasso and Miró foundation, the artists Jean-Charles de Castelbajac, Ara Starck, Florent Groc, Julien Colombier and many others to develop cushions, tapestries, fabrics and other accessories that will dress with character the interiors of today and tomorrow.      </p>
