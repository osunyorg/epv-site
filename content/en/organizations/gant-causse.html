<p>Since 1892, Maison Gant Causse has been perpetuating the tradition of fine glove-making in the heart of Millau. A precious heritage founded by Auguste Gant, Maison Gant Causse is part of a line of glove makers that dates back to the fourteenth century. Over the generations, the family has been able to pass on its manufacturing secrets, thus preserving a unique know-how. Today, Gant Causse masters all the stages of creating a luxury glove, from the selection of the noblest skins to the meticulous finishing. Each piece is handmade by experienced glove makers, using ancestral techniques.  <br></p>
