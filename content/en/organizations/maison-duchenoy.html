  <p>By sublimating the knowledge received as a legacy we awaken sensory emotions to enchant everyday life. We share the French style, putting enthusiasm, demand and audacity in all our creations. We create custom embroidery and exclusive collections for home decoration and linen.</p><p>Created by Jules Zéau – a handkerchief designer at the Grande Maison de Blanc in Paris – in 1903, MAISON DUCHÉNOY is a bold story that began in Paris, in the Tuileries district with the creation of the Jules Zéau Establishments, specialized in the creation of handkerchiefs, collars, guimps, collichets and household linen in laces and needle embroidery. </p><p>Le Point de Beauvais, home fetish technique: In 1956, the Maison turned to another embroidery know-how at the Point de Beauvais, to develop its finger shop. This crochet chain stitch, typical of 18th century styles, required long learning and a rare skill. A fetish technique from Jules Zéau, he will make his international fame. With over 10,000 models accumulated over the years, the Point de Beauvais design heritage of MAISON DUCHÉNOY is invaluable.</p><p>The needle embroidery, the first know-how of MAISON DUCHENOY: In 1995, Pascale Duchénoy, great-granddaughter of the founder Jules Zéau, who took over the torch of the family company in 1986, accompanied by her husband François, created an embroidery workshop on the island of Madagascar, specialized in needle embroidery technique. By this gesture, it preserves the founding profession of the family business, that of master finger.</p><p>A house run by Pascale and her children </p><p>Under the leadership of Pascale Duchénoy, the house was established in 30 years as an international reference. Surrounded by a team of designers, embroiderers, embroiderers, designers and seamstresses, Pascale and François Duchénoy successfully developed the company's activities around all the existing embroidery techniques with the support of its two workshops: the one located in Paris, the second in Madagascar. Pascale is now accompanied by her children, Marine and Aurélien, 5th generation to join the adventure.</p><p>Interior decoration </p><p>In 2013, Pascale and François Duchénoy anchor a new orientation of the house towards the interior decoration that the company started in 2000, with the creation of the brand Entrelacs. Designed for decorators and architects, this new activity allows them to impose themselves as the only French house, able to offer all the techniques of tailor-made embroidery for decoration and linen. A depository of many know-how, the house perpetuates the tradition of an elegant, refined and contemporary French style. His creations are now found in the most beautiful interiors around the world and are praised by the greatest interior decorators, architects or designers both French and international such as Alberto Pinto or Laura Gonzalez.</p><p>HOUSE DUCHENOY </p><p>In order to continue their transformation in the 3rd millennium, Pascale and François Duchénoy wanted to bring together in 2020 their two brands, Linge au Coeur, specialized in the manufacture of embroidered household linen and Entrelacs, in the exceptional embroidery for interior decoration, within the same brand named MAISON DUCHÉNOY. </p><p>With an incredible heritage of more than 15,000 original designs, enriched each year with collaborations between his studio and the greatest designers, MAISON DUCHENOY, in perpetual search for creativity, reinvents every day the craft of embroidery to transcend and sublimate it!</p><p>MAISON DUCHÉNOY was awarded the State label "Entreprise du Patrimoine Vivant" in 2009, distinguishing its expertise in embroidery. </p><p>Based on the work and passion of his workshops, MAISON DUCHÉNOY reinvents his ancestral techniques every day to offer his clients new and tailor-made creations. </p><p>His know-how of inger embroidery and furnishing embroidery is now integrated into exceptional interior decorations, and his rich archive of drawings serves as support for the development of new creative proposals. By combining old techniques and new embroidery processes, MAISON DUCHÉNOY succeeds in meeting the most sophisticated requirements of its international clients, to create the embroidery of tomorrow.</p>
