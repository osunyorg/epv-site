  <p>Célestin Tuffery began by creating work clothing by opening the Tuffery clothing workshop in Florac, in the heart of the Cévennes. Alphonse Tuffery, son of Célestin, discovered the profession of tailor-maker by observing his father in Nîmes. He understands the strong potential of the famous eponymous canvas, which will become denim. Atelier Tuffery's work pants used this canvas very early on and made the family house the oldest jeans manufacturer in France. In the 1960s, everyone wanted their own jeans and Atelier Tuffery employed up to 40 seamstresses to produce 500 jeans per day. It's time for the three Tuffery brothers to take over the family business and transform it into a brand. Julien Tuffery, 4th generation of the family of master tailors and makers, in turn passionate about this know-how, and with his wife Myriam decided to take over the family business and put the spotlight back on this treasure of French industry and know-how.  </p>
