  <p>Since 1834, in the heart of Saumur, the Combier distillery perpetuates a craftsmanship that has become rare. Nestled between white stones and the banks of the Loire, its historic stills resound every day including two authentic alambics with absinthe dating from the 19th century, unique pieces in France. Founded by Jean-Baptiste Combier, passionate about the fruits and aromas of the Loire Valley, the distillery quickly established itself as a pioneering house: Combier is the inventor of the very first Triple Sec in the world, a creation that has become an international reference in terms of cocktails. </p><p>With nearly two centuries of history, creation and high standards, the House is today recognized by the label Entreprise du Patrimoine Vivant, symbol of the excellence of its heritage and mastery of its expertise. At the head of production, Master distiller Franck Choisne passionately perpetuates the heritage of the Combier family. In love with plants, fruits and spices, he rigorously selects each raw material and masters each step with precision: maceration, distillation and blending to create spirits of incomparable authenticity and aromatic balance. </p><p>From iconic liqueurs to contemporary gins, fruity creams and premium syrups, each Combier creation promises a unique sensory signature: purity, intensity and elegance.</p>
