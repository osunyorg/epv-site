<p>It was in 1981 that Jean-Marie BONNET created the slicing factory in Assier to provide himself with a suitable structure allowing him to showcase his findings. Since the death of Mr. BONNET in April 2011, Agnès AUBERTIN has been in charge of the company and has enabled its establishment in the Asian market. She is surrounded by a team equipped with all the skills necessary for the processing of precious woods, ensuring the purchases of walnut and other woods (in France and Africa), their exploitation and their transformation. It is a young and motivated team, eager to maintain and even develop the very specific know-how that the France Noyer company has.  </p>
