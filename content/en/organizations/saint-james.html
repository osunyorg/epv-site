    <p>Exceptional sailboats, for him and for her </p>  <p>Pinterest <br>For over 130 years, SAINT JAMES has been committed to making quality marinières in France, in its workshops located in Normandy, in the eponymous town of Saint-James. <br> Notre histoire  <br>The creation of the Moulin du Prieur workshop <br>In 1850, the sailor sweater that would make the Saint James brand so successful and famous did not yet exist. Léon Legallais, mayor of Saint-James (Manche), the namesake of the future brand, founded a spinning mill called "Moulin du Prieur".</p>  <p>The family business weaves and dyes local wool. The wool is produced by "prés salés" sheep raised on the banks of the Couesnon River, in the bay of the famous Mont Saint-Michel, just a stone's throw from Saint-James. This high-quality wool is sold to the region's haberdashers and hosiery stores, which then market knitted hats, socks and other clothing items.</p>  <p>The birth of Saint James spinning mills and the sailor sweater <br>A few years later, in 1889, the Moulin du Prieur workshop officially became the Société Anonyme des Filatures de Saint-James.</p>  <p>Léon Legallais continued to manufacture balls and skeins for resale to haberdashers in Normandy and Brittany. He also decided to innovate, and began marketing the very first Saint James garment: the sailor sweater.</p>  <p>Knitted in a tight knit from the wool of salt meadow sheep, resistant and warm, it owes its name to the activity of fishermen in Brittany and Normandy. Between two fishing seasons in the North Atlantic, they used to cross the English Channel to sell garlic on the south coast of England.</p>  <p>For 6 or 7 months, the fishermen faced extreme conditions, braving inclement weather, rough seas and hard work. The sweater had to protect them from the cold as much as possible, without impeding their movements so as not to complicate maneuvering on the boats.</p>  <p>The 1950s to 1970s: a new turning point for Saint James <br>In 1950, the Saint James spinning mills were taken over by Julien Bonte, who decided to modernize the company and refocus its activities.</p>  <p>The sale of balls of wool and skeins became a thing of the past. From now on, Saint James concentrates on the manufacture of the "Vrai Chandail Marin", a name registered by the brand, which is then propelled to the rank of "French leader in marine knitwear".</p>  <p>From the English Channel to the Atlantic, by way of the Mediterranean, pleasure boating was attracting more and more holidaymakers, who enthusiastically embraced sailor style. In 1972, Bernard Bonte succeeded his father Julien Bonte at the head of the company, renamed Les Tricots Saint James in 1970.</p>  <p>Bernard Bonte contributes to the democratization of sailor clothing, and creates seasonal collections to appeal to French holidaymakers. From then on, Saint James garments were also woven, and new models were created, such as shirts and pants.</p>  <p>In 1976, the company, still based in Saint James, expanded and acquired new offices and workshops. By 1980, the brand was being exported to Tokyo and then all over the world, benefiting from an international aura.</p>  <p>From the 1990s to the present day: Saint James seduces families and designers alike <br>In 1990, to preserve the company's future and keep jobs in France, as Bernard Bonte had wished, the company was bought out by its employees. A "Reprise d'Entreprise par les Salariés" (RES) was carried out, and from then on the company's management board was chaired by Yannick Duval.</p>  <p>The company is reorganized, placing even greater emphasis on teamwork through the creation of autonomous groups that allow employees to change jobs on a regular basis. Saint James grows and gains market share, while continuing to expand internationally.</p>  <p>New collections of shirts, pants and jackets are launched, adopting a "casual chic" seafaring style that the brand still exemplifies to this day. The teams moved to new premises in 1996, before a further extension 5 years later, to provide logistics adapted to the brand's growth. In 2001, the factory and offices were extended to 11,000 m2.</p>  <p>In 2013, Luc Lesénécal, former deputy general manager of the Isigny Sainte-Mère dairy cooperative, took over the helm of the company, assisted by Patrice Guinebault, former deputy CFO of Saint James. The brand's garments seduced designers, and the marinière became an emblematic piece of French fashion.</p>  <p>Today, Saint James has over 300 employees and a network of some sixty stores, including thirty of its own.
