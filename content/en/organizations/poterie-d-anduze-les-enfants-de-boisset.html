  <p>Boisset pottery began its activity around the year 1610. At that time, it manufactured all kinds of utility pottery, oil jars, jugs. It was in the middle of the 18th century that Boisset pottery began to produce a vase with a horticultural purpose, drawing inspiration from the elegance of Medici vases and the opulence of the decorations of Florentine vases. Decorated with a garland, a crest: the Boisset vase was born. For four generations, pottery has been passed down from mother to daughter.  </p>
