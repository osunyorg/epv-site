  summary: >-
    <p>DUBOURDIEU NAVAL SHIPBUILDING is one of the oldest shipyards still in operation in France. Its history, spanning more than 200 years, is closely linked to the pinasses of the Arcachon Basin. Initially used for fishing and oyster farming, the pinasses evolved over time to become the distinctive pleasure boats that characterise the basin today. The Dubourdieu yard was the first to recognise the potential of this boat. After six generations of the Dubourdieu family, the site was left without an heir, but Emmanuel and Béatrice Martin took up the challenge and bought the site in September 2000. They have maintained the quality and demand that made the shipyard famous. Today, DUBOURDIEU 1800 creations can be found on seas around the world.</p>
