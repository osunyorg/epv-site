  <p>Located near Nantes, the company Arthema specializes in the conservation-restoration of works of art, and is organized around five areas of expertise: Sculpture ; stone, wood, terracotta, plaster, concrete and marble ; Polychromies and gilding : statuary, altarpieces, vaults, monumental mural paintings, ancient or contemporary works; Design office: preliminary studies for conservation-restoration, diagnostics and condition reports of cultural goods, technical support for the definition and implementation of restoration projects; Site management: coordination of partner teams (staff, carpenters, sculptors etc.) and assistance with project management; Dynamic anoxia (disinfestation treatment by oxygen deprivation of wood, paper and textiles). </p><p>Certified as a Living Heritage Company (EPV), and member of the Groupement des entreprises de restauration de monuments historiques (GMH), Arthema relies on the expertise of its team of conservators-restorers and decorative painters, which it places at the service of historical monuments, communities, museums, and private owners. </p><p>It is in Brittany, Pays de la Loire, Normandy, Centre-Val de Loire and Nouvelle-Aquitaine that it deploys its activity, as evidenced by the restoration of the church of the chapel of Notre-Dame de la Clarté of Saint-Eloi in Guilligomarc'h, the restoration of the tomb of François II and Marguerite de Foix at the cathedral of Nantes, or more recently the restoration of the church of Notre-Dame-la-Grande in Poitiers.  For all that, his occasional interventions, apart from his usual influence, remain significant, like the restoration of the triumphal arch of the Carrousel du Louvre and the external statues of the Sainte-Chapelle in Paris, or the study of the statues of the Cour Napoléon in the Louvre. </p>
