  <p>Maison Méert - A history of gourmetism and elegance<br>Founded in 1761 in Lille, the Maison Méert is one of the oldest pastries and confectionery in France still in operation.</p><p>It is especially famous for its waffle stuffed with Madagascar vanilla, a specialty that has become emblematic.</p><p>The house experienced a real boom in the 19th century thanks to Michael Paulus Gislinus Méert, a Belgian confectioner who gave his name to the house. It modernises the company, installs rue Esquermise in Lille (where the historic shop is still located) and introduces the influences of Belgian and Parisian pastry. Méert quickly became a prestigious address.</p><p>It provides several royal courses and attracts famous personalities such as Charles de Gaulle, who was a great amateur.</p><p>Over time, Méert diversifies its offer: chocolates, confectionery, teas, fine pastries, while maintaining its refined style and craftsmanship.</p><p>Méert today embodies elegance, the gastronomic heritage of the North of France, and the alliance between tradition and innovation. A true house of legend for gourmets.</p>
