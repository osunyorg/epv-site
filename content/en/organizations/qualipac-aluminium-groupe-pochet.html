  <p>Qualipac Aluminium, a subsidiary of the POCHET group, is located in St-Saturnin-du Limet, in the department of Mayenne, between Laval and Châteaubriant. On our site, we employ around 190 employees, as well as fifty temporary workers. Qualipac Aluminium designs and manufactures aluminium packaging solutions for prestigious clients in the luxury sector, including renowned brands such as Dior, Chanel, Hermès and Yves Saint Laurent. LVMH is the world’s leading luxury industry group that includes Dior, Givenchy, Guerlain, etc. but it is also the leading customer of Qualipac Aluminium. Founded in 1973, our site was once an old slate mine. </p><p>  The manufacturing process takes place as follows: we receive aluminum rolls that will pass through presses to give shape to the part. This step will be processed in the stamping workshop. Then, the parts go to the polishing workshop, where they are worked to give them a brushed appearance (striped effect), according to the desired effect of the client. Then, they will be transferred to the surface treatment workshop, where they will be immersed in acid baths to obtain a shiny or matte appearance; and give the desired color to the piece. Finally, the parts will go through the assembly workshop, where a part is dedicated to screen printing to decorate the parts, while another part will be dedicated to assembly when this step is necessary. This last step allows to finalize the manufacturing of the part by stamping the brand logo or by engraving writings on the product.</p>
