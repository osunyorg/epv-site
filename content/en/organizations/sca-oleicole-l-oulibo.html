  <p>Created in 1942, the Oulibo Cooperative is currently the only olive cooperative in the Aude department. It receives olives from three departments: Aude, Hérault and Pyrénées-Orientales, which certifies 100% regional products. Oulibo is above all people linked by the same passion, a land full of riches, carefully preserved traditions and artisanal know-how passed down from generation to generation.  </p>
