  <p>The history of Vitrail France began on 1 June 1928, when Auguste Avice joined forces with Louis Le Gac and Alexandre Chemin, whose company was located at 13 rue de l'étoile. The company Avice develops from the 50s, then in 1980 Didier Alliou buys the company which is renamed VITRAILFRANCE in 2004. Emmanuel Putanier, a long-time collaborator, will take over the company in 2014. </p><p>The will of Vitrail France is to remain a quality reference with a strong environmental commitment and applied today to work better tomorrow. Thus, the company has a highly qualified team with experience in traditional stained glass techniques; stained glass makers, restorers, colourists, site managers, draftswomen, health study manager, locksmith, ironworker etc.</p>
