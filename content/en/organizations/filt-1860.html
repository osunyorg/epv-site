    <p>Manufacture of nets and cords since 1860  <br>Filt 1860 has been making nets and cords in Normandy since 1860. Our mission is simple: to promote French textile know-how at home and around the world, thanks to the cords and nets we've been making in France for over 160 years! Since 1860, we've been making knitted netting on Rachel and crochet looms, as well as braided cords (3, 8, 12 and 16 plait braiders). Over the years, we've taken the right decisions, invested and surrounded ourselves with reliable suppliers and staff. We have the most modern machinery in Europe. Our in-depth knowledge of the European textile network enables us to maintain a cutting-edge technological watch. Manufacturing exclusively in France, we were awarded the "Entreprise du Patrimoine Vivant" label by the French government in 2017, in recognition of our excellent know-how. Whatever happens, we always put the human relationship first, before business. We use classic raw materials such as cotton, linen, polypropylene, polyester and specific yarns such as tin, copper, aramids, etc.... We are present in many fields of activity: transport, childcare, marine farming, water filtration, leisure, hunting, food processing, packaging and the now famous shopping net.</p>  <p>  </p>  <p>https://youtu.be/bd3Clx30gsM?si=Ex5-BrH2BgfGIv4K</p>
