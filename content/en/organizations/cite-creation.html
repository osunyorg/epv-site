<p>In 1983, as part of a cultural exchange between working-class neighborhoods, they travelled to Mexico. Working alongside Mexican artists in the teeming streets of the Tépito district, they learned to paint monumental murals using elements and testimonies drawn from daily life, and through passionate exchanges with local residents.</p><p>Six months later, they returned to France. After their first experiences in places of confinement, they worked in parallel in the beautiful districts of the city centers and in the suburbs. They invented an original profession, that of muralist.  </p>
