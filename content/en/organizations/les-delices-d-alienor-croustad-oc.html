  <p>  The bakery Les Délices D'Alienor, located in Gimont, in the heart of the Gascon territory, specializes in the manufacture of Pastis (Gascon and Landais) and Croustades. Their unique know-how, existing for more than 30 years, is exclusively based on the manual stretching of the dough. They are recognized by their label Entreprise du Patrimoine Vivant but also by the inclusion in the inventory of Culinary Heritage of France of their Pastis Gascon. Their products (apples, eggs, armagnac, etc.) come almost exclusively from producers in the region.    </p>
