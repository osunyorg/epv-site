<p>Founded by Lucien Albouy, this family business has survived the ages while preserving its authenticity and expertise in the manufacture of fancy yarns. Today, managed by Philippe Lauber, the spinning mill perpetuates the legacy of its founders by adopting an approach resolutely focused on quality and innovation. Specializing in the creation of unique yarns for haute couture and high-end furnishings, Lucien Albouy et Cie has established itself as a true national treasure. Golden knitting, twisted yarn, pompom yarn, roving yarn... The spinning mill has mastered to perfection the art of creating exceptional yarns, with shimmering colors and varied textures. Each thread is designed on demand, meeting the precise requirements of the most prestigious clients. Behind the magic of Lucien Albouy threads lies artisanal know-how of formidable precision. Old machines rub shoulders with cutting-edge technologies, orchestrating a harmonious ballet where tradition and innovation combine to give life to yarns of impeccable quality. </p>
