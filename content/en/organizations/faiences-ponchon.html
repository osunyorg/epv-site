  <p>The first wall tile factory<b>FAIENCE PONCHON</b>was founded in 1824, 8 factories succeed in this village of the Oise laid at the end of the clay sill called "the Buttonhole of the Country Bray."  The strongest of production was during the second half of the 19th century, the water arriving on sinks and buildings Haussmann on Paris, made this activity flourish. The tiles are hand decorated with floral inspirations or compositions Geometrical characteristics. The traditional colours of cobalt blue and Manganese are now accompanied by many nuances.  Present throughout the world, we find in particular these tiles of Ponchon in the house of Monet in Giverny, in the of Emile Zola in Medan, in the house of Pierre Auguste Renoir in Essoyes, in the castle of Vaux Le Vicomte and until Uruguay at Museo<i> </i>del azulejo...      </p>
