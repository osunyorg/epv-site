  <p>If the work of the gold leaf is a recognized art, less is known of the effects obtained by oxidation processes, or corrosion of brass, copper and silver sheets. Ulgador, a workshop halfway between alchemy, art and craftsmanship made these experiment with his ID card. </p><p>Founded by Hungarian artist Gabor Ulveczki, Ulgador is the name imagined to translate its know-how: the creation of gold decorative panels to the sheet of beaten metal. Applying metal sheets to glass, paper, wood or wood textile, Ulgador makes surfaces with changing, vibrant, living colors Even. It treats these surfaces as materials and creates patterns that offer a artistic expression and a visual identity unique to the interior in which the panels will then be installed in the form of wallpaper, screens, credences or table trays again. Thus, flowers, plants, graphic lines or Geometrics come to life under the skilful hands of Gabor and his daughter Rahel Ulveczki. </p><p>Together, they reinvent a traditional technique, and transform it for the project in a more contemporary world, adapted to the needs of architects and designers looking for exceptional surfaces.
