  <p>Anchored in Millau since 1900, Tanneries Pechdo perpetuates a unique know-how in the transformation of raw hides into supple and technical leathers.  She has mastered the art of sustainable, high-quality tannery. From the selection of the hides to the finishing of the leathers, Pechdo masters the entire tanning process.  It is the only manufacturer in Europe of supple and technical leathers from the flanks of cattle, goats and lambs. These leathers are intended for glovemaking, clothing and accessories. The reputation of this tannery is particularly based on its water, oil, electric arc and fire resistant leathers. In addition, they offer machine washable (WA) and tactile leathers. Their range also includes full-grain leathers with more classic finishes. </p>
