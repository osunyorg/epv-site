  <p>              Le Presse Papier, designer, publisher and manufacturer of exceptional wallpaper and fabrics, in the tradition of the Lyonnais canuts, resuscitates stories from the past in a passionate, iconoclastic and rebellious way. It is this subtle balance between tradition and contemporaneity, art craftsmanship and cutting- edge technical know-how, heritage preservation and ecological issues that it conveys through its collections. Le Presse Papier strikes a perfect artistic balance between its exclusive creations and the precious conservation and publication of period documents, which come back to the light under its exacting hand. An authentic and singular manufacture that writes its own history.</p>
