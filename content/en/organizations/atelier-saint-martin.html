  <p>The name of the metalwork and ironwork workshop in Morillon comes from a Roman tribune stationed in Amiens. During a freezing winter, he came across a Gaul dying of cold. The tribune drew his sword from its sheath and cut his cloak in two, giving one half to the poor man.</p><p>Since 2010, F. Andrès, passionate about his craft, has developed a way of working closely with his customers, striving to fully satisfy them in various fields of application, including metalworking. This allows Frédéric and his apprentices to design and execute various building projects according to best practices.</p><p>Creating a ‘house spirit’ is an integral part of Atelier Saint Martin, with its specific expertise combined with respect for cultural, technical, artistic and... human values.</p><p>For F. Andrès, human beings, with their strong values, form the philosophy of the company, with an entrepreneurial spirit that has been passed down through two generations.</p><p>‘Always listen, contemplate and learn in order to flourish, build and construct for the long term, leave a beautiful mark and pass on knowledge with heart and sincerity’ are words that express the essential values advocated by F. Andrès and his father Jacques before him.</p><p>These values and interpersonal skills combine with expertise to foster excellence. They form the basis of a code of conduct that is expressed on a daily basis at Atelier Saint Martin.</p><p>Translated with DeepL.com (free version)</p>
