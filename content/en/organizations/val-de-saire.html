    <p>Marine sweaters and accessories Made in France  <br>Established in the 1960s, our family business settled in Valcanville in 1979, the heart of the Cotentin region where our family roots lie. Our collections draw inspiration from the landscapes of this wild peninsula, its inhabitants proud of their traditions, as well as a world in constant evolution. Our productions tell a story, one of a style where quality, comfort, and creativity subtly intertwine. Val de Saire is renowned for its craftsmanship and the quality of its workshop. We also expand our presence alongside renowned fashion houses that seek our collaboration. Our team of professionals, recruited locally, oversees every stage of creation from our design office, knitting, and manufacturing to hand finishing. Our Tricoterie thus guarantees its customers products of impeccable quality, labeled EPV (Entreprise du Patrimoine Vivant - Living Heritage Company).</p>  <p>  </p>  <p>https://arsen-normandie.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/arsen-val-de-saire-video-salon.mp4</p>
