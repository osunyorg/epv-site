    <p>Offering the best of Isigny's terroir to professionals  <br>Founded in 1909 in Normandy and rooted in an exceptional terroir, the Isigny Sainte-Mère Cooperative is world-renowned for its traditionally high-quality dairy products. Thanks to the richness of its producers' milk, recognized as an exceptional raw material, Isigny Sainte-Mère produces butters, creams and cheeses whose unique flavors have earned it an international reputation. Isigny Sainte-Mère also manufactures infant milk powder, an expertise it has acquired over the decades. This infant milk is manufactured for customers all over the world. The quality of its products is the result of unique, age-old traditional know-how. Isigny Sainte-Mère benefits from a unique and protected terroir, the best Normandy has to offer: tender grass, whose growth is influenced by the salt spray from the nearby sea and the fresh water from the marshes of the Bessin and Cotentin regions; a rich soil and humid climate that make Isigny milk the pride of an entire region. Collected within a 50 km radius of the Cooperative, the milk is transported to Isigny Sainte-Mère as soon as it has been milked, so that it retains all its properties. Its aromatic richness and quality are appreciated in France and around the world. The men and women of the Cooperative, milk producers and employees, work hard every day to produce and add value to the milk of their region, to make products of excellence.</p>  <p>  </p>  <p>https://youtu.be/KTgXSySN_4g?si=Vv42wA4sijdnE31e</p>
