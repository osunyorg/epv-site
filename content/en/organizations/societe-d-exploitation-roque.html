  <p>Collioure anchovies have a long history for the Roque family. In 1870, Alphonse Roque established himself in Collioure as a cooper-salter. In 1922, his son Léon Roque founded the family business then, in 1969, created the Roque company for his children, Renée and Guy. Today, still located in Collioure, Guy Roque and his children perpetuate the tradition with constant know-how.  </p>
