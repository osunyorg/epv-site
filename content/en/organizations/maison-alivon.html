  <p><b>The letters of nobility of Maison Alovon</b></p><p>Maison Aivon is the oldest and last of the bronze character manufacturers in the world. Thanks to a unique process of melting with a spoon, Maison Alovon creates the tools for marking gilders, binders, cabinetmakers, luthiers, like the greatest chocolate makers. Maison Alovon is heir to rare ancestral know-how and a family heritage transmitted from generation to generation, thanks to a passion that remains intact for bronze and its multiple expressions.</p><p>Now carried by Marion Sausser's talent and energy, Maison Alovon is no longer just a renowned manufacturer, but a place where designers and artists rediscover bronze, thanks to Marion's creativity and the previously unexplored prospects offered by this hard and sensitive metal.</p><p>Maison Alovon Éditions was born out of Marion Sausser's ability to grasp the beauty that resides in every "workshop memory" of the factory to make it an art object. "Nothing gets lost, everything changes." This is particularly true at Maison Alovon Éditions: it is a virtuous bet, raised both by commitment and by natural creativity. To sublimate the residual material without altering its character makes this collection of art objects, curiosities for initiates, unheard-of jewels and exceptional usuals unique of its kind.</p><p>In this singular universe, between heritage and innovation, Maison Alovon signs its passage of an elegant, controlled and generous gesture.</p>
