  <p>Created in 1846, the company based in Angers is today managed since ten years by Mr. DEPONTBRIAND Benoit, where an ancestral know-how endures. Without mechanization or advanced technology, experience, talent and know-how are the key elements of this company specialized in stained glass. Mr. DEPONTBRIAND supervises a team with varied profiles (designer and glass worker, master glass worker and stained-glass window assembler) who creates and restores the stained glass by integrating the locksmith work from moving to replacement. </p><p>-  The design of your stained glass begins at the stage of sketching, then engraving, on a model by our painter artist. The manufacturing will follow the steps and practices developed over centuries by master glassmakers and passed on to specialists in stained glass creation. </p><p>-  Aware of the inestimable value, both sentimental and historical, of the pieces and masterpieces entrusted to them, the professionals at Barthe-Bordereau adhere to rigorous specifications at each stage of the restoration of the stained glass windows entrusted to them. </p><p>-  The work of the locksmith is inseparable from the art of the stained glass maker. Structure ensuring the rigidity of the stained glass, but also securing the parts and protective grids against the elements and external aggressions... These essential components for the stained glass installation are manufactured in our locksmith workshop, attached to that of renovation and creation.</p>
