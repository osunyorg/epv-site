  <p>At Maison Loubière, an art ironworks company, each piece is a unique work, crafted with passion and precision by our highly qualified iron craftsmen. From the classicism of the Renaissance to the purity of Art Deco, they intervene in every corner of France. L'Atelier Loubière thus restores all its lustre to a candelabra, rebuilds a dome or an armature, revitalizes the ornaments of a grille, protects the stained glass windows from bad weather. </p><p>From short to long-term projects, each project begins as a new challenge. L'Atelier Loubière has forged its excellence in metals, capable of reviving the brilliance of a piece as if it were crafted from scratch.</p>
