    <p>ARTS AND CRAFTS AND MASTER GLASSMAKERS IN NORMANDY</p>

    <p>GLASS, between TRADITION and modernism  <br>The art of stained glass dates back to the Middle Ages, and reached its apogee in the Gothic period. During this period, stained glass windows were used in churches and other religious buildings. After a period of decline, a veritable renaissance took place in the Art Nouveau period, from around 1880 to 1920, followed by Art Deco. Think of the liners and luxury trains criss-crossing Europe. Today, there's a real craze: It's not "just" about preserving heritage, but also restoring and enhancing it. This is obviously true for religious buildings: cathedrals, churches, chapels... but also for stained-glass windows in official buildings: town halls, railway stations, post offices, schools... Then there are the remarkable stained-glass windows found in collectors' and private homes, in the form of doors, windows, bow-windows... or in restaurants as wall decorations, ceiling lights, lamps and sconces. All styles and schools are represented. Stained glass blends perfectly with architecture. Modern glassmakers create large panels that bring spaces to life. The trend is to make the most of what already exists and to seek out quality and durability. The return of the "handmade" is remarkable, after decades of disposable mass industry. It's light that brings stained glass to life, that makes it vibrate, that fills us with wonder every time we look at it, depending on the brightness of the day. Our workshop restores old stained-glass windows according to the rules of the art, and also creates stained-glass windows according to the wishes of our customers, whether companies or private individuals, working closely together on theme, design, color and style.</p>  <p>  </p>  <p>https://youtu.be/qPK1BDyBOSg?si=fMnWiMmUW1jpO8ca</p>
