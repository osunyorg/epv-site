  <p>The Armenian Paper® company has been producing perfumed burning paper since 1885. During a trip to Armenia, Auguste Ponsot notes that the inhabitants perfume and disinfect their homes by burning Benjoin, a tree resin found in Laos. </p><p>He decides to import this product into France. His partner, the pharmacist Henri Rivier, discovers that by causing the benjoin to dissolve in alcohol at 90° you get a persistent smell. The addition of perfume gives a pleasant and tenacious aromatic mixture. All we have to do is find support. It will be a blotting paper that absorbs the mixture while preserving the original smell of the Benjoin and is slowly consumed without making a flame. Mireille Schvartz, the great-granddaughter of Henri Rivier, perpetuates the family tradition by scrupulously respecting this unique know-how that makes the success of Paper of Armenia®. </p><p>She was able to develop the family business by offering two other carnet scents and the corresponding candles. The workshop is still in Montrouge and includes a dozen people.</p>
