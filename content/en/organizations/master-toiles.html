    Master Toiles
  summary: >-
    <p>Since 1968, the family-run company MASTER TOILES has manufactured linen canvases and high-end chassis for painters. The company works in compliance with traditional carpentry techniques, shaping pine frames from Landes forests certified by the PEFC scheme. The team has mastered the traditional techniques of bonding, coating and covering canvases on the chassis, as well as the custom manufacture of variously shaped chassis. The company's strength also lies in its ability to offer custom-made frames with or without canvas to its customers. In November 2022, the company was awarded the Living Heritage Company label. The MASTER TOILES® brand is engraved on all of the company's products, guaranteeing their origin and the fact that they are 100% French-made.</p>
