  <p>  The Crambes company was created by Auguste Crambes, a worker in the felt hat sector in Aude in Esperaza. On the advice of a friend, he moved to Tarn et Garonne in Caussade, the city of hats. The company is growing rapidly and needs to expand. In 1968, his daughter, who took over from him, bought a carpentry workshop to build a new building. The company then has nearly 7,000 m² and employs around 250 employees. Recognized as a "Living Heritage Company", Crambes now manufactures 400 hats per day and markets around 300,000 pieces per year. Crambes works for many well-known brands, particularly in the luxury sector. It also produces hats and caps under its own brand.    </p>
