  <p>For 6 generations, the Brassac family has practised this trade. First in Auvergne, where the family has its roots. It was here that the family's first pewter potters criss-crossed the region, going from village to village in their handcarts to make pewter tableware to order, in particular spoons and ‘1 sou forks’. The first moulds were made of sand or clay, and it was not until much later that bronze moulds appeared. At the beginning of the 20th century, Théo Brassac and his family first moved to the Ain region. Then, shortly before the Second World War, they moved to Romans sur Isère in the Drôme. </p><p>The First and Second World Wars saw a sharp decline in the tin-potting business. Because of the scarcity of metals and the closure of tin mines in France, it was necessary to wait a few years for the first arrivals of raw materials from South America and Asia. From an early age, François Brassac learned the trade alongside his father, Théo, and his two brothers, Pierre and Jean, until 1952, when he decided to set up his own pewter manufacturing business and left. To set up his business, François needed capital, and for 5 years he worked as a glazier and floor-covering fitter. It wasn't until 5 years later that his company was set up in Bourg de Péage (a town near Romans). The beginnings were difficult, as everything had to be done: the first drawings, the first moulds, and finally the first pewter articles.</p><p>A few years later, his skills were recognised by all. He became a Master Pewterer and created his own hallmarks, which still appear today on every object made by Le Potier d'Étain.</p><p>His creations are recognised throughout France and abroad, particularly in Canada, where in 1980 he opened Le Potier d'Étain Inc, a subsidiary of the French company.</p><p>In 1983, Patrick Brassac, his son, joined the company to learn the trade.  </p>
