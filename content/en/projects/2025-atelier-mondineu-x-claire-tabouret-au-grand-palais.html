    Atelier Mondineu X Claire Tabouret au Grand Palais
  summary: >-
    <p>Creation of the 329 frames of the preliminary drawings of the stained glass windows of Notre-Dame proposed by Claire Stoolet for his exhibition at the Grand Palais</p>
  body: >-
    <p>Mondineu Workshop </p>  <p>   <br>For his exhibition With one breath, Claire Stool invests Gallery 10.2 of the Grand Palais by choosing to present the life-size models, sketches and other preparatory works of the six future contemporary stained glass windows for Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris. In December 2024, Claire Stool, in association with L'Atelier Simon-Marq, was named winner of the consultation initiated by the public institution Rebâtir Notre-Dame de Paris for the creation of contemporary stained glass windows for Notre-Dame de Paris. Since then, Claire Stool has been working on life-size models for six bays on the south side of Notre-Dame's nave. To respond to the invitation of the Grand Palais, the artist proposes to unveil the behind the scenes of this extraordinary creation by exposing these "cardboards", sketches and other preparatory works. Due to the historical character of the project, Claire Stool would like to invite the public to accompany him in this adventure and offer him a first look at life-size models, while the stained glass windows will still be being manufactured at the Simon-Marq workshop. Each of the 329 fragments that make up the 6 bays of the future stained glass windows was framed by the Mondineu Workshop. In order to marry the particular form of each fragment, it was necessary to create patterns in advance of all the works. In keeping with its commitments regarding the provenance of wood and framing techniques, each stick was designed based on these principles:  <br> noble materials (honey) carefully selected,  <br> home making,  <br> high-end finishes integrated with museum requirements,  <br> choice of suitable anti-reflective lenses and storage cartons.  <br> The supervision of the works of the exhibition Claire Stool, with one breath, benefits from the Mrs. Kristin Johnson and her family contributed generously.</p>  <p> Atelier Mondineu X Claire Tabouret au Grand Palais </p>  <p>https://youtu.be/O_7QS6DyzqQ <br>Atelier Mondineu X Claire Tabouret au Grand Palais</p>  <p> Further information  <br>   <br>Press release of the exhibition</p>  <p>  </p>  <p>Exhibition at the Grand Palais <br>https://www.grandpalais.fr/fr/programme/eva-jospin-grottesco-claire-tabouret-dun-seul-souffle</p>
