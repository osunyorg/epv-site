        <p>From February 26,2020 to January 3,2021, the Palais de la Porte Dorée presented an exhibition devoted to the work and imagination of Christian Louboutin, shoe designer and a key figure in the fashion world.</p><p>Unveiling Christian Louboutin's inspirations and creative process, the exhibition showcases his vision through some of the most precious works from his personal collection, as well as loans from public collections. A wide selection of shoes were on display, some never before exhibited.</p><p>A series of eight stained glass windows, specially designed and created for the exhibition by the Maison du Vitrail de Paris under the direction of Master Glassmaker Emmanuelle Andrieux, illustrate the constituent elements of the designer's work: the Parisienne, show business, couture, art, travel, craftsmanship, sexuality and innovation. The Salle des vitraux also houses the first 300 models designed and conceived by the designer himself.</p><p>These heritage and artistic pieces are displayed alongside a number of exclusive collaborations that underline Christian Louboutin's attachment to know-how and craftsmanship.</p>
