    Matali Crasset X Tissage Moutet
  summary: >-
    <p>Inspired by Tissage Moutet's archives, the world-famous designer has created a collection of 6 projects that renew table linen and its uses.</p>
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>To celebrate its 100th anniversary, Basque weaver Atelier Moutet decided to develop an anniversary collection with Matali Crasset. Matali Crasset travels through worlds that are, to say the least, eclectic. From crafts to electronic music; from the textile industry to fair trade; from scenography to furniture; from graphic design to architecture... the industrial designer (by training) has established herself as a great creator, who loves to break the codes that govern our daily lives. I wanted to preserve this Basque strength by adding a vibrancy to it," she explains. It's not just an everyday product or a decorative element. The company is on a human scale. It has values and conveys beautiful messages: authenticity, the relationship with nature, the environment... it gives us the opportunity, through domestic rituals, to affirm things," concludes Matali. <br>Find out more on the Tissage Moutetwebsite, or in the IDEATarticle.</p>
