    Le Jacquard Français x Jean-Michel Wilmotte
  summary: >-
    <p>CLUB by Wilmotte is a singular collection born of a dialogue between two exceptional French crafts. One: artisanal and secular; the other: architectural and visionary.</p>
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>An exclusive collaboration Architect Jean-Michel Wilmotte's research into Jacquard weaving has drawn on his artistic sensibility to create a resolutely timeless collection. Jean-Michel Wilmotte's work on composition and the balance of shapes and colors has focused on rediscovering the self-evident character of the object and the sensuality of the material. New "Bath Club" collection For the Autumn-Winter season, the Club by Wilmotte collection joins the world of bathrooms and spas with the new Bath Club range. Lightweight, technical 100% cotton creations, woven in double honeycomb in the Vosges. An architectural collection where fabrics come to life like the sketchbook dear to Jean-Michel Wilmotte. The constructive gesture of architectural structures and weaving weaves respond and harmonize to give rise to a confidential collection whose contemporary lines and deep colors lend sophistication and elegance. Sleek and intimate, Bath Club is an invitation to relaxation and well-being. Let's join the Club</p>
