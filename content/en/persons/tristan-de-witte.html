biography: >-
  <p>  With a lifelong passion for local know-how and artisanal values combining functionality, aesthetics and respect for materials, I worked first for CDC Entreprises and then BPI France - supporting heritage brands and Excellence know-how - before founding Rivalen in 2017. At the crossroads between family business and industrial holding, Rivalen describes itself as an investor-architect, aggregator of a collective of French industries, shaping and developing the Excellence know-how of women and men, brands and companies. Today, Rivalen has 180 employees and four brands - Roger Pradier, Sécurlite, Brossier-Saderne and Luzeva. And because it was obvious to me that the collective embodies human and environmental values, we took up the challenge of becoming a mission-driven company in April 2022.  </p>
