    Richesses: report on the EPV Auvergne Rhône-Alpes
  summary: >-
    <p>The "Entreprise du Patrimoine Vivant" (EPV) label is a government recognition mark, set up to distinguish French companies, among others, for their outstanding industrial and craft skills.</p>
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>Since its creation in 2005, the EPV label has highlighted unique companies that know how to reconcile innovation and tradition, know-how and creation, work and passion, heritage and future, local and international. This state label is attached to the Ministry of the Economy and Finance and awarded by the regional prefects. The State has entrusted the management of this label to the Institut National des Métiers d'Art (INMA) in 2019. Awarded for a period of five years, this label brings together manufacturers who share a certain vision of what their company should be doing: high performance of their craft and products, constant attention to in-house training, a technically and socially innovative approach, and a dynamic sales strategy. It is the only government label awarded to a company for its entire activity, guaranteeing the excellence of its know-how. In 2021, the 1,448 companies awarded the label in France were active in 8 different market segments. In total, they employed 69,260 people, with cumulative sales of €15.6 billion. The EPV network is essentially made up of SMEs. At national level, the establishments are divided into 8 market sectors:  <br> Furniture and decoration (23%)  <br>  <br> Fashion and beauty (21%)  <br>  <br> Architecture and built heritage (14%)  <br>  <br> Gastronomy (13%)  <br>  <br> Culture and communication (11%)  <br>  <br> Tableware (7%)  <br>  <br> Leisure and transport (6%)  <br>  <br> Industrial, medical and mechanical equipment (5%)  <br>  <br> The Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region boasts 288 EPV-labeled establishments, or 15% of the total.
