    <p>A look back at the event marking the end of 2023 : the award of the EPV label at the Nantes Prefecture.</p>
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>On 12 December 2023, the EPV label diplomas were officially awarded at the Nantes Prefecture. It was an opportunity to receive a gift before Christmas, to mark the end of the year but also to meet the newly labelled companies and prepare for 2024 !This celebration marked the end of the year by rewarding exceptional companies that have distinguished themselves through their know-how, by awarding them the diploma symbolising their integration into the EPV community or the renewal of their status for a period of five years.Each area of the region has its own specific characteristics when it comes to skills of excellence: the Val de Loire for stonework and architecture, the Choletais for fashion and textiles, as well as in the fields of graphic arts or popular traditions...Thank you to everyone who took part in this event, and we look forward to seeing you in 2024 to take part in various projects !</p>  <p>  </p>  <p>Label EPV</p>  <p>Label EPV</p>
