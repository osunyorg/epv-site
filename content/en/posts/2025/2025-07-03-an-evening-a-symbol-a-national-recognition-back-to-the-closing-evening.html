    <p>20 years of the EPV Label: Presidential recognition for companies of excellence  <br>   <br>On July 3, the closing night of the 20th anniversary of the 20th anniversary of the Entreprise du Patrimoine Vivant (EPV) label was held in a prestigious setting: the 7th floor of the Ministry of Economy and Finance in Bercy. An exceptional event organized by the Directorate-General for Enterprise and the Ministry of Economy and Finance in the presence of Mrs Véronique Louwagie, Minister Delegate responsible for Enterprise and the President of Réseau Excellence, Mr Tristan de Witte. <br> This evening brought together many companies labeled EPV, members of the Excellence Network, as well as loyal partners and supporters of the label. A highlight of recognition and sharing around French expertise of excellence.</p>  <p> A high presidential patronage: a unique recognition!  <br>   <br>An important moment of the evening: the EVPs present had the honour of receiving the birthday gift reserved for all the labeled: the high patronage of the President of the Republic.  A prestigious distinction, symbol of the attention paid by the State to the influence of these unique companies, guaranteeing a rare, often ancestral, know-how and deeply rooted in the territories.  This high patronage is more than a symbol: it brings real added value to labeled companies, enhancing their visibility, credibility and attractiveness, both in France and internationally. It is a real development lever for those who embody French artisanal and industrial excellence.</p>  <p> A work blown at Biot's Glassware: craftsmanship in the spotlight  <br>   <br>As part of these celebrations, Minister Véronique Louwagie went to Biot's glass factory, EPV company. During this visit, she blew herself the vase presented. Here is a symbolic experience that embodies both the valorization of traditional know-how and the state's commitment to crafts. <br>This strong gesture highlights the richness, diversity and vitality of French crafts, represented with passion by EPV companies. <br> The EPV label celebrates 20 years of commitment to value French excellence. More than ever, it is a guarantee of quality, passion and sustainability for the companies that proudly carry it.</p>  <p>  </p>  <p>  Célia Bonnin  </p>  <p>  Célia Bonnin  </p>  <p>  Célia Bonnin  </p>  <p>  Célia Bonnin  </p>  <p>  Célia Bonnin  </p>
