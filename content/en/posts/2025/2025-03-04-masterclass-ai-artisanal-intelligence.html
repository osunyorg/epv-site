  body: >-
    <p>  <br>March 3, 2025, the workshops  Procédés Chénel , members of the  French Craft  and EPV, welcomed Henri Danzin and Charles de Dainville ( Maison Jaùh // French Craft), to share their daily experience of this multi-faceted tool. A live demonstration explored each step of the process, in interaction with the public. Valentin Goux ( Rinck //Réseau Excellence) then showed how he was already integrating the AI into his business, from furniture design to interior architecture, translation, content creation, photo editing and much more. The event ended with a friendly moment in the Procédés Chénel showroom. A huge thank you to  Procédés Chénel International  for his welcome and the discovery of his magical universe! Thanks.  JAUH  and  Valentin Goux  for their intervention and sharing! Thanks to  French Craft Guild  for this collaboration!</p>
