    Signature of a cooperation agreement between the Mobilier national / Manufactures nationales – Sèvres and Réseau Excellence EPV
  summary: >-
    <p>June 4, 2025, at the heart of the Reserve Perret of the Mobilier national, we had the pleasure and honor to gather large signatures of French architecture alongside houses EPV labeled excellence for an exceptional evening, in the presence of Rachida Dati, Minister of Culture, Catherine Vautrin, Minister of Work, Véronique Louwagie, Minister for SMEs and former Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin.      </p>
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>Organized by Réseau Excellence <br>EPV  Contract,  the dinner was <br>set with elegance by Jean-Michel Wilmotte, ambassador of this club, combining <br>heritage and creation. <br> This highlight was marked by <br>the official signing of a cooperation agreement between the </p>  <p>Mobilier national / Manufactures nationales - Sèvres and Réseau Excellence to formalize <br>their joint commitment to six strategic areas of preservation <br>and the development of know-how of excellence, crafts, the  decorative arts, and French design: <br>  <br> Training and transmission <br>  <br> Applied research <br>  <br> Contemporary Creation <br>  <br> Support for the fragile ecosystem of SMEs in all territories <br>  <br> The development of material cultures and <br>gesture <br>  <br> The national and international reach of <br>national manufacturers and enterprises <br>  <br> For Hervé Lemoine, President of the</p>  <p>Mobilier national / Manufactures nationales - Sèvres:  “This is a first. Bringing together companies from the living heritage sector, along with decorators, interior architects, designers... all these players in a sector of excellence who promote French talent, particularly abroad. And it is this somewhat novel combination that we are trying to create through this strategic agreement, which will be its strength and usefulness.” "The label has rarely been <br>so strong! I see it as a strong symbol, 20 years after its creation. <br>Whatever our EVP sectors, our common denominator is that of <br>excellence. This is what makes the wealth of the 1500 companies that have <br>so many things to do together, to build the dynamics we do need in France, combining creation and know-how,  stated <br>Tristan de Witte, President of Réseau Excellence. <br> A huge thank you to the teams of the <br>Mobilier national for their trust and hospitality in this emblematic place. <br> This evening couldn't have been <br>place without the valuable support of our partners: Fauchon Hospitality, Le <br>Jacquard Français, Champagne Bollinger, Mayenne Webs, and Wilmotte & <br>Associates, whom we thank very warmly.</p>
