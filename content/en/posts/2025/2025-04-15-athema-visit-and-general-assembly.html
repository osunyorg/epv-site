    <p>  <br>On Tuesday 15 April 2025, ARTHEMA co-managers welcomed the members of Réseau Excellence Pays de la Loire to their new premises in Bouguenais. We discovered sculptures during restoration and all the expertise and passion of men and women who work on the conservation and restoration of paintings, sculptures and art objects. This meeting was also an opportunity to make the association's AG and to talk about business prospecting with an external stakeholder, Christophe AUBRIOT. This presentation allowed passionate exchanges around a dinner cocktail.</p>
