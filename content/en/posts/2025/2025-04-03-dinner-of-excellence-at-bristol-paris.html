    Dinner of Excellence at Bristol Paris
  summary: >-
    <p>In the hearty setting of <i>Hotel Le Bristol,</i> itself EPV   labeled, held the first Réseau Excellence <i>Contract </i>dinner party.</p>
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>On April 2, the first Réseau Excellence EPV Contract Dinner was held. It was a rare, inspiring evening, carried by voices of commitment, united around a shared ambition: to showcase French know-how at its noblest, liveliest and most visionary. We had the immense honor of being accompanied by Jean-Pierre Raffarin, former Prime Minister, whose clear, humanistic words, deeply rooted in the general interest, gave our exchanges a special intensity. His sincere commitment to culture, transmission and exceptional know-how resonated powerfully with the EPV companies present. His support is a strong sign for us, and we offer him our sincerest gratitude. At his side were leading figures from the hotel industry, design, institutions and the creative world:   Hervé Lemoine ( Mobilier national )  Jacques-Olivier CHAUVIN   Michel COTTRAY   Mélanie Leroy Rapoport   Gilles Bonan   Oscar Lucien Ono   soline rouland   Gabrielle Joinau Tavernier   Arnaud LEURENT . </p>  <p>And, of course, the companies that have been awarded the Entreprise du Patrimoine Vivant (Living Heritage Company) label, the guardians of rare, excellent and exceptional know-how, and veritable living pillars of our French heritage:</p>  <p> Tristan De Witte  -  Roger Pradier ® - Outdoor Lighting   Tristan Rodriguez  -  Horus   Valentin Goux  -  RINCK   Edouard Dumas  -  La Compagnie Dumas   Beatrice Brandt  -  LE JACQUARD FRANCAIS   Emmanuelle Andrieux  -  La Maison du Vitrail   Gaël Hardy  -  CREZE Métallerie d'Art   Charles-Henri Deon  -  Tréca Paris   Mathieu Gritti  -  Focus Creation   Christophe Beausoleil  -  Maison LOUBIERE   Damien Chapuis  -  Ateliers Jean-Baptiste Chapuis   Grégory LAURENT  -  ÉTAINS DE LYON   We addressed four fundamental themes: - The international influence of French expertise - Hospitality and the art of living as levers of influence - Regions of excellence as showcases of France - Transmission as a founding act and a challenge for the future But above all, we made concrete commitments. Collective, structuring and sustainable actions, which will see the light of day in the months to come, at the service of our network, our country and the artisans who make it shine.   Excellence is not a slogan. It's a way of being in the world. It's a way of inhabiting gestures, giving meaning to materials, and bringing the past into dialogue with the future. What we stand for cannot be proclaimed: it has to be embodied. It's up to us to make this embodiment a collective, visible and radiant force. A French signature that inspires the world.  </p>  <p>  </p>  <p>Alain Delorme    </p>  <p>Alain Delorme     </p>  <p>Alain Delorme   </p>  <p>Alain Delorme   </p>  <p>Alain Delorme   </p>  <p>Alain Delorme   </p>  <p>Alain Delorme   </p>  <p>Alain Delorme   </p>  <p>Alain Delorme   </p>  <p>Alain Delorme   </p>
