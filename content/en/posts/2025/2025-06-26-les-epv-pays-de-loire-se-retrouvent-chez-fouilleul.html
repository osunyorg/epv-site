    The EPV Pays de Loire meet at Fuilleul The presential on Pays de Loire

    <p>  <br>Matthias de Chavagnac showed us the FOUILLEUL company on 24 June 2025.  Former tannery installed along a river, Fuilleul became a specialist in cutting and forming parts. Fouilleul is 12 people, a business figure of 1.3 million. 50% of the AC is made with TP distributors involved in water supply.  In fact, the company mainly manufactures seals for professionals. More than 500 references are proposed to adapt to the customer's exact need. In addition, 25% of the activity is carried out with the leather goods sector, in particular the Parisian luxury players, these are mainly leather handle reliefs, round or profiled. In the cutting shop, we discover amazing machines such as water jet cutting tables or a piece cutter with a robot, digital cutting with a knife, custom cutting, optical quality control system and many others. Intimately located in the premises, two small workshops offer a meticulous work of stamping leather parts. Leathers are prepared with a flask and a smoother, as in tanneries. They are then trained to carry out technical objects, in particular. The company was purchased by Matthias in 2022; The big plan ahead is to move. Following this visit, we discussed the carbon balance. Florian and Alexis d'Orace presented this topic. Orace, an association financed notably by the Region, assists companies in the Pays de Loire in their CSR activities. The association offers Webinars, trainings, clubs, loans of measuring machines, ...  Florian presented us with carbon balances showing the importance of the impact of supply and transport. The idea of a balance sheet is to go back with actions to improve it. As usual, the evening is over with a dinner snack! Thanks to Matthias and his friendly family for the welcome!</p>  <p> Photos matinale Pays de la loire </p>
