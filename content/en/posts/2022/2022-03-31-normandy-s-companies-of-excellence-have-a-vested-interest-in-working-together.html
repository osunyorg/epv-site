    Normandy's companies of excellence have a vested interest in working together
  summary: >-
    <p>Recognized internationally for their expertise and the quality of their products, Normandy's companies of excellence have every interest in working together. This is the credo of Luc Lesénécal, head of Tricots Saint-James and president of ARSEN (Association régionale de l'excellence normande).</p>

    <p>  <br>At a time when consumers are increasingly attentive to issues of quality, origin, and the virtuous nature of products, Normandy's excellence companies have everything to appeal. There are 50 of them today grouped within ARSEN (Association régionale de l'excellence normande), created in 2017 with the support of the Normandy Region. "Cross-fertilization "The strength of our association is to bring together recognized companies, developing start-ups, EPV-labeled and non-EPV-labeled companies, in a spirit of cross-fertilization," insists Luc Lesénécal. The head of Tricots Saint-James and Chairman of ARSEN believes in the virtues of teamwork, and likes the idea of "hunting in a pack", particularly when it comes to exporting, as he explains in this video interview. Playing collectively in a buoyant sector Know-how of excellence is a very buoyant sector, both in France and abroad. "The 'Made in France' market is growing, particularly in the luxury goods sector, which is enjoying annual growth of 4-5%," confirms Luc Lesénécal. Against this backdrop, ARSEN federates its members around regular operations: breakfasts, Made in France trade fairs, Olympiades des métiers, FÊNO, promotional films. "We have also carried out co-branding operations, resulting in the creation of joint products. Tricots Saint-James and Romain Brifault, for example, designed a wedding dress together. What's special about an industry like ARSEN is that it brings together companies of all sizes and from a wide range of sectors. "What they have in common is that they all possess a gesture that is sometimes unique, often passed down from worker to worker, and which contributes to Normandy's reputation. By joining forces, they can work together on topical issues such as CSR and cybersecurity. Export is also an important area of collective work for these companies. "Two-thirds of these EPVs (Entreprises du Patrimoine Vivant) export. You have to know how to hunt in a pack. "The EPV label is not a gadget! Since its creation in 2005, the state label "EPV" (Entreprise du Patrimoine Vivant - Living Heritage Company) has spotlighted companies that know how to reconcile innovation and tradition, know-how and creation, heritage and future. Administered by the Institut National des Métiers d'Art, it is attached to the Ministry of the Economy and Finance. In Normandy: 60 companies have been awarded the EPV label (4,800 jobs), 30% of which were created before 1900! To obtain this label, a CSR approach is now required. This label, which is free of charge, is not a gadget," insists Luc Lesénécal, "it's a real recognition of the company, its qualities of transmission and know-how as human capital. For Tricots Saint-James, for example, it takes 18 months to 2 years of training per position. It is also an asset for export, "particularly to Asian countries (Japan, South Korea), which are very sensitive to product quality and country of origin. The EPV label also highlights the company's ongoing focus on in-house training and sales strategy. It brings media coverage and can be accompanied by an advantageous tax regime.
