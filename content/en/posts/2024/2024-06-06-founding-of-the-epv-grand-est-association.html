  summary: >-
    <p>The Grand-Est region is reinforcing the excellence of its know-how with the creation of the Association EPV Grand-Est, a new network dedicated to Entreprises du Patrimoine Vivant (Living Heritage Companies), officially launched on June 6, 2024 in Strasbourg.</p>
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>The official launch of the Association EPV Grand-Est took place on Thursday June 6 at the CCI Alsace Eurométropole, located at the Espace Européen de l'Entreprise in Strasbourg. This new association brings together the 140 Entreprises du Patrimoine Vivant (EPV) in the Grand-Est region, which enjoy undisputed recognition from their customers, suppliers, partners and employees, both in France and internationally. Despite this individual recognition, it has become apparent that the EPV network effect in this region has not yet reached the scale it could legitimately represent.The region's EPV companies, though diverse in size and sector of activity, share common values and ambitions. They face similar challenges, but are not in direct competition. With this in mind, a group of companies decided to set up a dedicated regional association to strengthen ties between these economic players.The government also announced the creation of an EPV incubator at the end of 2023, with the ambition of identifying companies likely to obtain the label, with the aim of reaching 2,500 EPVs by 2025.Just over 1,000 companies currently hold the label.</p>  <p> A project to unite the EPVs of the Grand-Est region  <br>Inspired by similar initiatives in other regions of France, the Association EPV Grand-Est aims to bring together as many of the region's 140 EPVs as possible. The main objective is to create synergies between members by developing inter-company relations, tackling common issues, and carrying out collective projects to boost their activities. At the same time, the association aims to raise the profile and influence of the EPV label, both nationally and internationally.</p>
