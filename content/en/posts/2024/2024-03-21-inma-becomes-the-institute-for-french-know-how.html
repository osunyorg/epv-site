    INMA becomes the Institute for French Know-How
  summary: >-
    <p>A new institute with unprecedented ambitions, based on the fundamental missions initiated in 1899, to promote, preserve and develop excellence in know-how.</p>
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>The Institut National des Métiers d'Art (INMA) becomes the Institut pour les Savoir-Faire Français! This name change, the 4th in the Institute's 135-year history, marks a historic turning point, presenting an Institute on the move, adapting to the times and the issues facing the professionals it federates. This transformation is the culmination of restructuring work undertaken since 2019, following the integration of the  Entreprise du Patrimoine Vivant (EPV) - L'excellence des savoir-faire français label , which the French government entrusted to the Institute. Far from dismissing the notion of "métiers d'art", which remains at the heart of the Institut's missions, this new terminology is intended to unite the thousands of professionals for whom the Institut works, and to enable them to be better identified by the general public, both in France and internationally.
