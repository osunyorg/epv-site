    <p>  <br>On Thursday 26 September 2024, Texaa, a company based in Gradignan, Gironde, which was certified Living Heritage Company label in 2023, welcomed the fledgling regional association of Entreprises du Patrimoine Vivant (Living Heritage Companies) from the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region and its partners, including the Leather, Luxury Textiles and Arts and Crafts sector of the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region and the consular networks.Entreprises du Patrimoine Vivant (Living Heritage Companies) from all over the Nouvelle-Aquitaine region came to the meeting, keen to get to know each other and discuss the EPV label, their expectations and the regional association's action plans. The meeting provided an opportunity to present the new communications banner, Réseau Excellence, supported by the Association Nationale des Entreprises du Patrimoine Vivant, which has become the Federation of the 12 regional EPV associations.Thanks to a fascinating tour led by Matthieu Demptos, head of EPV Texaa, and its teams, all the participants were able to discover the expertise of Texaa, a company specialising in the design, development and manufacture of materials, panels and objects designed to improve the acoustic comfort of all types of interior spaces.</p>
