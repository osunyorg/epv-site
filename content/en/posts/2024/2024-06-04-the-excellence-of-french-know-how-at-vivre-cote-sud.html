    <p>  <br>Manufactures of calenders or calenders <br>jams, confectionery or roasters, manufacturers of sails, saddlery, Mehari engines and <br>2CV, sandals of Saint-Tropez, but also potters, soap makers, glassmakers, santonniers, <br>manufacturers of art and decoration objects... These actors in responsible manufacturing <br>and respectful who commit themselves to the quality and durability of their products as well as to <br>the well-being and training of the talents that shape them, were present on the pavilion "EPV", in resonance to the theme of the Salon  Living South  of this year: "Anchoring and Metisage". 26,000 expected visitors (80 per cent general public, 20 per cent professional) were able to discover these creative and passionate ambassadors, women and men of the South Region's Living Heritage Enterprises, at the forefront of their trades and <br>new expectations. To be labeled EPV is to carry a future project on the territory with the <br>young people who are trained there: that of anchoring a French manufacture of excellence in a heritage <br>which makes our shared pride. Coordinator of this presence, the EPVs </p>  <p>Regional Association</p>  <p> whose purpose is to bring together and promote the EPV-labelled companies of the region. <br>Distinguished by the state, these companies wear high colors of craft excellence and <br>French industrial throughout the world.</p>  <p> THE EPVs PAVILLON & EXHIBITION Space  <br>Brun de Vian Tiran  <br> </p>  <p>In 1808, in Isle-sur-la-Sorgue, Charles Tiran and Laurent Vian set up a mill on the banks of the Sorgue River and began felting the region's checkered cloth. Today, Camargue horses still wear this checkered cloth, and the factory has become a truly responsible ecosystem, a model for a sustainable world. As France's leading processor of French wool, it has rediscovered the finest wool in Europe, Mérinos d'Arles Antique(R), through a sustainable partnership with shepherds.</p>  <p> Chocolaterie de Puyricard  <br> </p>  <p>Since 1967, Chocolaterie de Puyricard has remained an artisanal company rich in expertise and creativity, driven by an undeniable passion for quality workmanship and the selection of excellent raw materials. With a network of 23 stores spread across its native Provence, Toulouse, and Paris, Chocolaterie de Puyricard demonstrates its passion for "handmade chocolate" and the emotions it evokes on a daily basis. It also showcases its expertise as an ice cream maker and confectioner in Provence.</p>  <p> Confiserie du Roy René  <br> </p>  <p>Confiserie du Roy René is a family business that has been making calissons, nougats, and other sweets since 1920 in Aix-en-Provence. Now celebrating its centenary, the company can be proud of having preserved the artisanal expertise passed down through three generations. The company was awarded the EPV label in 2012 and, as such, is committed to apprenticeships and "skills tourism" through the Calisson Museum, respecting and preserving the heritage values of its region.</p>  <p> Dragées Reynaud </p>  <p>For two generations, Dragées Reynaud has preserved and perpetuated a unique artisanal expertise in the production of sugared almonds: Avola sugared almonds (made with almonds reputed to be the best in the world), classic sugared almonds, 70% cocoa chocolate, and even novelty varieties. Since 2020, the "Provence" range has expanded to include almonds coated in chocolate with I.G.P. honey from Provence, A.O.C. olive oil from Aix-en-Provence, rosemary, and almond dragées with 44% almonds from Provence.</p>  <p> Fer à Cheval </p>  <p>With over 160 years of history, Savonnerie Fer à Cheval continues to use the traditional Marseille soap manufacturing and saponification method in cauldrons, following the authentic "Marseillaise" method. It was in the 19th century, in the Phocaean city, that hundreds of small factories made soap the flagship product of Marseille. The company has retained its artisanal spirit and patiently crafts soap that is not perfect, but very much alive.</p>  <p> Nougats Boyer </p>  <p>It is in Sault, at the foot of Mont Ventoux, that André Boyer, Master Confectioner and Nougat Maker since 1887, crafts white nougat, dark nougat, Provençal macaroons, small spelt galettes, calissons, old-fashioned marshmallows, and more, all made according to traditional recipes. An exceptional collection of rare French honeys completes the range. The team of confectioners, pastry chefs, and nougat makers still work using traditional methods, with high standards in the selection of raw materials and a preference for short supply chains.</p>  <p> La Corvette </p>  <p>Savonnerie du Midi Awarded the "Entreprise du Patrimoine Vivant" (Living Heritage Company) label, Savonnerie du Midi is one of the last manufacturers based in Marseille that produces Marseille soap according to the rules defined by Colbert's Edict in 1688. In the heart of the Aygalades district, soap is still made by master soap makers who have worked there for over a century, using large cauldrons. Five cauldrons are currently in use, with a capacity of 10 to 20 tons, producing soaps sold under various brands, including La Corvette, "the benchmark for Marseille soap since 1894 ."</p>  <p>   <br>AGRO'NOVAE Comtes de Provence  s an independent family-owned food manufacturer located in Peyruis, in the Alpes-de-Haute-Provence (04) region, which has been creating, producing, and marketing fruit-based specialties and ingredients since 1986. Known for its traditional expertise and its specific manufacturing process as a Living Heritage Company, the company promotes its values through its brand “Les Comtes de Provence”: creativity, naturalness, quality, and French and Provençal culinary traditions. 2CV Méhari Club de Cassis </p>  <p>Recognized by all enthusiasts of vintage Citroëns, the MCC was entrusted by the manufacturer more than 20 years ago with its original tools in order to reproduce parts for the Méhari and 2CV, which it had stopped producing. Through its renovation, upholstery, and metalworking workshops, the teams have continued this tradition and unique expertise, enabling them to preserve this part of French automotive heritage.</p>  <p> La Verrerie de Biot </p>  <p>While the tradition of glassmaking in Provence dates back a thousand years, in Biot it all began in 1956, when La Verrerie de Biot created bubbled glass. Today, this family-run company continues to fly the flag for contemporary craftsmanship. It has mastered the art of bubbles, turning a flaw into a feature: bubbled glass. The soul of Biot glassware lies in its bubbles, making each piece unique.</p>  <p> Léonard Parli </p>  <p>Maison PARLI was founded in 1874 by Léonard Parli, a Swiss confectioner who discovered a sweet called Calisson during a trip to Aix-en-Provence. He was captivated by this delicacy and decided to establish the first Calisson factory in Aix. Renowned for the quality of its confectionery, its specialty, Calisson d'Aix-en-Provence, is famous for its pronounced almond flavor and the unique texture of its paste, the result of traditional craftsmanship.</p>  <p> K-Jacques </p>  <p>Since 1933, Maison K.JACQUES has been perpetuating rare skills by designing and manufacturing authentic Saint-Tropez sandals. Every stage of the design process, from creation to customization, is carried out entirely within the family workshop in Saint-Tropez.</p>  <p> Savonnerie Marseillaise de la Licorne </p>  <p>Pierre Bruna was the first master soap maker in the family. Today, Serge Bruna, Master Soap Maker, and his wife Laurence continue the tradition of artisanal soap making. Raw Marseille soap is crushed with granite rollers to give it fineness and softness. A mixer is used to blend the ingredients that go into the soap, such as honey, essential oils, lavender buds, and other fine products. The soaps are stamped by hand or molded.</p>  <p> UPSM: Union of Marseille Soap Professionals When it was founded in 2011, the UPSM set itself the mission of defending, promoting, and raising awareness of authentic Marseille soap. We are working to gain recognition for the traditional expertise behind Marseille soap by obtaining a GI (Geographical Indication), in order to preserve this living heritage of the Bouches-du-Rhône region!    Savonnerie Fer à Cheval, Savonnerie Marius Fabre, Savonnerie du Midi, and Savonnerie Le Sérail are the founding members of the Union des Professionnels du Savon de Marseille (Union of Marseille Soap Professionals).  For over 120 years, the  Marius Fabre family soap factory has been continuing the traditional manufacture of Marseille soap and black soap made with olive oil. Since 1949, the</p>  <p> Le Sérail  soap factory has been manufacturing genuine Marseille soap in the traditional way, cooked in a cauldron using old-fashioned methods. A family tradition that lives on.</p>
