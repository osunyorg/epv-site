    <p>Here's a look back at our last meeting between EPV Pays de la Loire on 19 March at Grav'Or in the Sarthe region.</p>
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>On Tuesday 19 March 2024, the  Réseau Excellence Pays de la Loire association  had the opportunity to discover the expertise of  Grav'Or , a company that has specialised in custom-made glass since 1982. It was also an opportunity to talk about the EPV label and to hold the association's General Meeting. Isabelle Ratiskol  took us on a tour of  Grav'Or 's glassmaking facilities, where we observed the results of each stage of production, from cutting to the different techniques used to meet the requirements of each customer. We then had the pleasure of holding the Annual General Meeting, at which we discussed the Association's activities in 2023, both financial and moral, as well as current and future initiatives for 2024. Finally, in a friendly atmosphere, we talked about the EPV label, to help  Grav'Or  prepare its application. </p>  <p>  </p>  <p>Finishing techniques</p>  <p>Hand-in-hand</p>  <p>Infinite possibilities </p>  <p>Made-to-measure colouring</p>
