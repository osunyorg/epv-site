    <p>  <br>Created in 2005, the "Entreprise du Patrimoine Vivant" (EPV) label is designed to distinguish French companies in mainland France and the French overseas departments and territories that possess excellent craftsmanship and industrial know-how. SGS ICS, a subsidiary of the SGS France Group, won the tender issued by the French Ministry of the Economy, Finance and Industrial and Digital Sovereignty to manage the award and promotion of the Entreprise du Patrimoine Vivant (EPV) label. The label is a source of confidence in exceptional French know-how. It is the only government label awarded to a company for its entire activity. "The EPV label embodies the excellence of French know-how, a precious heritage that we are committed to preserving and promoting with passion and determination. As the pilot of this prestigious mark of recognition, we are honored to shine the spotlight on the exceptional craftsmanship and industry that make up the richness of our living heritage. With our unwavering commitment and vast expertise, we will work to ensure that the EPV label continues to symbolize excellence and authenticity throughout the world. Together, driven by our passion for our professions, we will continue to write this story - your story, our story - to promote French know-how and work for a better future."  Siham VIDARD, President of SGS ICS.</p>
